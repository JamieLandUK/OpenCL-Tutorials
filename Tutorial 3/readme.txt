Programming Assignment

To run this program, open "OpenCL Tutorials.sln" and build "Tutorial 3" with its kernels.
This will create the x64/Debug folder and from there please copy the datasets into the same level as the created .exe. There is also a smaller dataset provided in 'files/' which contains an even smaller dataset which has been proven to work completely.
If you wish to change the dataset used, navigate to line 91 and change the string in file.open() to what you want to test.
